# Rubiks Cube & AI 

I'm not sure what question I'm trying to answer yet. All I know is that I have a script for scraping [reco.nz](https://reco.nz/) for valid 3x3 reconstructions, and a tokenizer for turning these moves into something that can be used by a model. 

I'll figure out what I'm actually doing later.
